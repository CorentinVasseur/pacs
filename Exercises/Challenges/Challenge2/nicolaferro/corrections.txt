- The correct idea would have been to have a single driver for the
  adaptive schemes, capable of using rk45 or rk23 step in
  alternative. You have a lot of code duplicated in rk45() and
  rk23(). You could have created a rk_adaptive receiving the specific
  method as argument. Also the main() would have been simpler.

- Why not create a struct to gather all parameters? It makes the code
  more compact. The parameters could have been read from a file.

  struct rkParam
  {
  double t0;
  double T;
  double y0;
  ......
  }
