Function for Runge Kutta 45 and 23 adaptive time integration with no optimal step calculation.

For scalar ODE of the form dy/dt = f(y,t)

make static makes the static library
make dynamic the shared libary
make installs installs in PACS_ROOT/include and PACS_ROOT/lib

make will also crete the executable.

bash plot23.sh and plot45.sh use gnuplot to shot the result, accordingly to the scheme chosen.
