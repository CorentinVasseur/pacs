Function for Runge Kutta 45 and 23 adaptive time integration.

For scalar ODE of the form dy/dt = f(y,t)
Here I've just two methods, so I fixed the options in the main, but I could change it and pass them from the command line at run time too. 
The interesting things are that I pass all the options and also the stepping method as the arguments of the function rk. Passing everything by arguments of rk function I have a more general code.
I decided to pass the rk step function by a pointer to the function step that I want to use.

For RK23 I had to increase a lot the number of iteration and to change c2 according to the order of the method.

I just copied the Makefile and Makefile.inc to allow to solve the callenge. 

make static makes the static library
make dynamic the shared libary

make will also crete the executable.

bash plot.sh uses gnuplot to shot the result

In this version I pass from the command line which method I want to use, for example:

./main_rk RK45 or ./main_rk RK23
