- The idea of a defining a type for the function defining the type of time stepping is excellent.

- The program cold be neater by defining stucts to contain related data for instance
 
 struct rkOptions{
     unsigned int maxSteps;
     doube desiredError....
     };

etc. This way one avoids to have a lot of function parameters! 

- There is nothing wrong in using char pointers	like char* scheme  in function rk, yet remember that std::string is more flexible.


Well done.
