Function for Runge Kutta 45 or 23 adaptive time integration.

For scalar ODE of the form dy/dt = f(y,t)

make static makes the static library
make dynamic the shared libary
make installs installs in PACS_ROOT/include and PACS_ROOT/lib

make will also crete the executable, you have to choose the step methods in command line:
./main_rk rk23
./main_rk rk45 


bash plot23.sh and plot45.sh use gnuplot to shot the result.
