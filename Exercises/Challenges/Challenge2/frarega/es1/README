Function for Runge Kutta adaptive time integration.

For scalar ODE of the form dy/dt = f(y,t)

make will create the executable.
make clean will clean executable and objects.
make distclean will clean result.dat too.

./main will start the program, and will ask the user to choose the step method.
Otherwise, you can specify the desired step function by command line:
./main rk23
./main RK23
./main rk45
./main RK45

bash plot.sh uses gnuplot to shot the result
