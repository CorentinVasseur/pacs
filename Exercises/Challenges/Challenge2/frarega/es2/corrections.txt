**COMMENTS**

-Using standard exceptions instead of calling exit is better.

- No need to include muparser.h in the main. Is already included in muParserFunction.hpp. It is not an error, but it is misleading: it indicates that the main() is using something declared by muparser, while it is not.

- Why are you including cstring?  Not needed.

- Good reading data from file and using getpot for parsing. 

- Good the switch between reading from file and reading from terminal.

- if (k_met>0 and k_met<3) ok=true;  ->  ok=(k_met>0 and k_met<3)  (SIMPLER!) By the way, nice the use of the keyword and, introduced in c++11

- Nice the idea of printing the options

**ERRORS**

-No relevant errors.
