Function for Runge Kutta adaptive time integration.
For scalar ODE of the form dy/dt = f(y,t).

make will create the executable.
make clean will clean executable and objects.
make distclean will clean result.dat too.

Equation specifications and solver options can be set either by command line or read form a file.
Each option has a default value, except for the function f(t,x), the exact solution (not mandatory) and the step method.
If you don't specify one of these options, you will be asked to type them at runtime. Since the exact solution is not necessary in order to solve the equation, you will be asked about it only when the computation is completed.

OPTIONS FILE:
If you want options to be read from a file, use the "-f filename.pot" or "--file filename.pot" option. (if you just type "-f" or "--file" the default file "options.pot" will be looked for). Examples of option files are "options.pot", "options2.pot", "exponential.pot" contained in this directory.

OPTIONS BY COMMAND LINE:
If you want to set options by command line, here is the full list of parameters you can choose. Descriptions are provided in "options.pot". Remember to use the sintax "y0=1":
	fun (no default value. remember to put the formula between "...")
	y0 (default value: 1)
	t0 (default value: 0)
	T (default value: 100)
	sol (no default value. remember to put the formula between "...")
	method ("rk23" or "rk45". no default value)
	h_init (default value: 0.2)
	errorDesired (default value: 1.e-7)
	maxSteps (default value: if rk23 is chosen, 1.e6, otherwise 1.e4)
	c1 (default value: 1)
	c2 (default value: if rk23 is chosen, 1/16, otherwise 1/64)

If you want all the options to be shown (either options are set by command line or are read form a file), just use the option "-p" or "--print-options".

bash plot.sh uses gnuplot to shot the result

EXAMPLES OF USAGE:
./main 
./main -f
./main -f exponential.pot -p
./main fun="-sin(t)" sol="cos(t)" y0=1
./main method=rk45 errorDesired=1.e-6


NOTES ON INSTALLATION:
The program uses the muparser library. If the library is installed in your pacs/Examples/lib directory, you may have to add this path to the environment variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH. (e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH+=";/home/pacs_student/Documents/pacs/Examples/lib")
