Challenge1:
I want a set containing the edges of the mesh without repetition (31 is the same as 13).
The mesh is a vector of triangles. Each triangle is identified by three points, so I need to build the edges from this points. Having all the edges in a vector I can fill the set of the edges without repetition.
