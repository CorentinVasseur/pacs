- Good use header and source files., with header guard (for the header file!)



Errors

You do not put header guards in cpp files. No reasons to do that.


Minor notes.

- Do not include headers you do not need! algorithm is not needed in edge.hpp for instance.

- Better use member initializer list when constructing:

struct Edge{
	unsigned first;
	unsigned second;
	Edge(const unsigned &a,const unsigned &b):first(a),second(b){}
};

Create a target clean in the Makefile. It helps!
